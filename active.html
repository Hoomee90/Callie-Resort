  <h1>Horrifing Activites</h1>
  <h2>Innocence lost is more valuable than knowledge gained</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>Mandatory Engagement</h3>
  <p>Partake in a theoretically finite number of required tasks over the duration of your stay. Don't worry, we'll make sure death will not free you. If you are partnered with one of <strong>the anointed</strong> for any task, please alert a staff member. There's been a horrible mistake. </p>
  <h3>Classic labors include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Daedalus tag</li>
    <li>Canvassing the empty void in place of your heart</li>
    <li>Debating a nihilist</li>
  </ul>
